## Codebook for run.analysis.R

*A brief description of each variables in a test.set2 which will be created from the run_analysis.R

*sbj* : subject number (n=30)
*activity* : subject's movements (n=6)

Other variables (e.g. tbodyAccX, tbodyAccY, etc.) are means and standard deviations of detailed features of each movement
More descriptions are below:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
